		#Searching for BOLA

        ask questions like?
              - what can you do with this app?
              - do we get own profile?
              - can we upload files?
              - do we have account balance?
              - is there any part of the app that has data specific with you account?

		#Authorization Testing Strategy:
		
		when searching for authorization vulnerablities, the most effective way to find authorization weakness
		is to create TWO accounts and perform A-B testing.
		
			we could do this by using userA resources with userB token.
			
		
		GET /identity/api/v2/vehicle/9431-b75/location   
		
			{
				"carId": "9431-b75"
				"vehicleLocation": {
					"id": 1
				}
				"fullName": "hapiUserB"
			}
