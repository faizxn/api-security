	#Classical Authentication Attacks# 
	
		#brute-force
		
		its like brute-force and password spraying. to perfrom the attack, need to leverage the information revealed in an excessive data exposure vulnerability.
		the excess data could reveal technical details about the users account like user is using multifactor authentication.

		wfuzz -d '{"email":"a@email.com","password":"FUZZ"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -u http://127.0.0.1:8888/identity/api/auth/login --hc 405

  
  		#password-spraying#
		
		many security controls could prevent you from successfully brute-forcing an API authentication. a technique called "Password Spraying" that can evade.
		collection username or email address from post-comment which is "excessive-data-exposure"
				
		save the response (below save to file) of post-comment and other targeted files and filter email address using grep
				grep -oe "[a-zA-Z0-9._]\+@[a-zA-Z]\+.[a-zA-Z]\+" response.json
		
			
		#Note on Base64 Encoding#

			some APIs will base64-encode authentication payloads sent in an API request.
