	#Mass Assisgnment Attacks
	
		mass assignment vulnerablities are present when an attacker is able to overwrite object 
		properties that they should not be able to. 
		
		an attacker is able to add parameters to user registration process that escalate their account from basic to administrator
			
		look for parameters involved in user {account properties.. critical functions and administrative actions..}
		
			lets intercept the account registration for crAPI and send it to repeater.. 
				send a sucessful request to have baseline understanding of how API responds..
				
			we can add a variable that API providers likely to use  to identify admins. key-values to JSON POST body..
				
				"isadmin": true,
				"admin":1
				
		once we attempt to a mass assignment attack on target, we will need to analyze how API reponds.



	#Fuzzing for Mass Assignment with Param Miner

		right click on a request on registration sign-up page on intercept 
		
			select Extentions > Param Miner > Guess Params > Guess JSON Paramter 		|| body is JSON format
			
			navigate back to Extender > Extentions and Parm Miner 
					Next, select the Output tab and wait for results to populate this area
					
			If any new parameters is detected, insert them back into the original request and fuzz for results.
